BERLIN CLOCK

This is a Java implementation of Berlin Clock Kata using Test Driven Development.

The Berlin Clock is a clock that tells the time using a series of illuminated coloured blocks.

The top lamp blinks to show seconds- it is illuminated on even seconds and off on odd seconds.

The next two rows represent hours. The upper row represents 5 hour blocks and is made up of 4 red lamps.
The lower row represents 1 hour blocks and is also made up of 4 red lamps.

The final two rows represent the minutes. The upper row represents 5 minute blocks, and is made up of 11 lamps-
every third lamp is red, the rest are yellow. The bottom row represents 1 minute blocks, and is made up of 4 yellow lamps.

The aim of the exercise is to convert digital time into Berlin Clock time. Individual test cases have been added to test
conversion for seconds lamp, five hours row, single hours row, five minutes row, single minutes row and complete time conversion.
